        Define the core features of the app (packing list generator, itinerary manager, etc.).
        Create wireframes and mockups using Figma.
        Set up version control with Git and GitHub.
        
    Phase 2: Frontend Development
        Implement the basic layout with HTML and CSS.
        Build reusable UI components with React.js.
        Integrate responsive design using Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS.
        Set up state management in React to handle user interactions.
        
    Phase 3: Backend Development
        Set up the Node.js server with Express.js.
        Design RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.
        Implement user authentication with Firebase.
        Develop data models and connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
        Integrate Python scripts for web scraping and connect them with the backend.
    
    Phase 4: Integration and Testing
        Connect frontend components with backend APIs.
        Test the entire application using Postman and Jest/Mocha.
        Optimize performance and fix any bugs.

    Phase 5: Deployment and Launch
        Deploy the application on Heroku or Vercel.
        Set up continuous deployment for easy updates.
        Monitor the app for any issues post-launch and gather user feedback.

    Phase 6: Post-Launch

        Consider adding more features like real-time chat support, weather 
            integration, or a travel journal feature.
