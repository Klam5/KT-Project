THIS TEXT FILE CONTAINS THE BLUEPRINT WE INTEND TO IMPLEMENT

PROJECT GOAL: Create TRAVELER - A Fullstack Webapp
    
    Problem:
        - Traveling is already stressful enough. There are tons of
          things to worry about: packing, safety, activities, vaccinations,
          plane tickets, weather - the list goes on and on.

        - There is so much research to do, and even more if you are completely
          unaware of the conditions of the destination.

        - In hopes of simplifying the process, we want to put everything in one
          place so no one is left unprepared.

    Why?
        - Summer of 2024 family and friends took a 60 person trip to belize, and
          many weren't aware of passport rules, forgot to bring bug spray, and 
          the right footwear. They became large inconviences and no one wants
          to deal with that while on vacation and getting away.

    Solution:
        - We want to simplify it by creating a website in which you select a 
          destination(s) and it lists all the things you should bring
            Ex: If your destination is near the equator, it will most likely
                be warm, so pack shorts, bug spray for mosquitos, and bring 
                sunscreen.
        
        - Additionally, we will webscrape to find must see/do things pertaining
          to the destination, and allow users to add these activities to their
          itinerary. After, tweak the list of items to bring to accomodate
          for these activities.

    What will we learn?
        - User Authentication, database usage (user info)
        - Js frameworks such as react, node, etc.
        - Maybe usage of API's
        - Web Scraping, live hosting
        - Fullstack development (backend + frontend)
